# Welcome to the MOViewRS Page!

## This is a subsection to the main repository, MissouriView

You will find the link to the page, along with a short description of the contents you will encounter while exploring our MOViewRS page. There are a few tutorials for you to follow along with and put your remote sensing, GIS, and Machine Learning/Artifical Intelligence skills to the test!

This repository contains scripts for three different parts - part 1 for data preprocessing, training a CNN model, and application of the model to WV-3 imagery; part 2 includes scripts for pixel-based machine/deep learning algorithms (SVM, RF, and DNN) available only to instructors who would like to use this material for their machine learning course; and part 3 includes a tutorial for forest change analysis using grid-cell approach.

The goal of this repository is to create a tropical forest map (with other land cover/use type) using U-NET as the segmentation algorithm. The imagery used is WorldView-3 (WV-3), which contains 16 bands (8 bands in the visible region and 8 bands in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) region).

Cota et al. (2021) used a Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCNN) as an end-to-end pixel-based (SVM, RF, and DNN) and patch-based (CNN) image classifier of high-resolution satellite imagery, which was one of the very first implementation of GeoAI to forest conservation and human geography.
